    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Chicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients. 
        The classic chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are pasta, noodles, dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley. 
        Chicken soup has acquired the reputation of a folk remedy for colds and influenza, and in many countries is considered a comfort food.</p>
        <p>Humans were already boiling food by the time that chicken was domesticated in the neolithic period, so it is likely that chickens were being boiled for soup.
            Modern American chicken soup, which typically includes root vegetables such as carrot, onion, leeks and celery, was a staple across Northern Europe and was brought to the United States by immigrants.
        </p>
        <p>Chicken soup can be a relatively low fat food: fat can be removed by chilling the soup after cooking and skimming the layer of congealed fat from the top.A study determined that "prolonged cooking of a bone in soup increases the calcium content of the soup when cooked at an acidic, but not at a neutral pH".</p>
